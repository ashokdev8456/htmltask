The legendary city of Ayodhya, popularly identified as the present-day Ayodhya, is known as the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama of Kosala and is the setting of the great epic Ramayana and its many versions. This belief is the main reason for Ayodhya being venerated as an extremely holy city for Hindus.Owing to the belief as the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya has been regarded as the first of the seven most important pilgrimage sites for Hindus.</br>It is believed that a temple stood at the supposed birth spot of Rama, which was demolished by the orders of either the Mughal emperor Babur or Aurangzeb, and a mosque erected in its place.In 1992, the dispute over the spot led to the demolition of the mosque by Hindu mobs, who aimed to rebuild a grand temple of Rama at the site.A five-judge full bench of the Supreme Court heard the title cases from August to October 2019 and ruled that the land belonged to the government per tax records, and ordered it to be handed over to a trust to build a Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternative 2.0 hectares (5 acres) of land to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build a mosque in lieu of the demolished Babri mosque. The construction of Ram Mandir commenced in August 2020</p>

As per early estimates, the Prasanth Varma directorial starring Teja Sajja in the leading role earned ₹9.45 crore on Thursday in India. Even though it’s a dip of 16.67%, it is still a good number since it’s the seventh day since its release. The movie has been released in Telugu and Hindi.
was a huge Saturday for HanuMan as the Hindi version ended up collecting almost double what it had done the day before. On the second Friday, the film had collected 2.05 crores at the box office, and now, on the second Saturday (day 9), the collections have zoomed up to 4.02 crores. This is simply excellent, as in its opening weekend, too, there was a jump where collections moved from 2.15 crores to 4.05 crores, and now that has happened all over again in the second weekend, too.

Now, the Teja Sajja starrer is assured of a lifetime of over 50 crores as the overall numbers are already near 30 crores. With 28.99 crores in its kitty already, today, the collections should reach around 35 crores, and from there, gathering those 15 crores more won’t be an issue at all. In fact, given the manner in which the film is running at the box office, the making cost would be recovered through the combination of Hindi theatrical collections and moolah that comes from OTT and satellite.
